List of ships:
 
- Battleship,  with four holes
- Cruiser,  with three holes
- Submarine,  with two holes
- Destroyer,  with one hole.

Each player has ONE Battleship, TWO Cruisers, THREE Submarines and FOUR Destroyers.

Each ship must be placed horizontally or vertically — not diagonally — across grid spaces. Ships can’t touch each other and they can't occupy the same grid space. You cannot change the position of the 
ships after the game begins.

GOOD LUCK!

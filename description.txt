Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players (you vs AI) in which the opponents try to guess the location of the other's various ships.The object of the game is to guess the location of the ships each player hides on a board containing vertical and horizontal space coordinates. Players take turns calling out row and column coordinates on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a square that contains a ship. 

Each player receives a board with two grids and ten ships. One of the grids is used by the player to "hide" the location of his own ships, while the other grid is used to record the shots fired toward the opponent and to document whether those shots were hits(green) or misses(white). The goal of the game is to sink all of the opponent's ships by correctly guessing their location on the grid. If AI hit or sank human’s ship it’s marked on grid by red sharp.
